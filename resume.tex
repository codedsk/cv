% Don't like 10pt? Try 11pt or 12pt
\documentclass[10pt]{article}
\RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}

% The automated optical recognition software used to digitize resume
% information works best with fonts that do not have serifs. This
% command uses a sans serif font throughout. Uncomment both lines (or at
% least the second) to restore a Roman font (i.e., a font with serifs).
\usepackage{times}
\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}

% The OCR software also has a hard time with italics. These commands get
% rid of the two common ways to italicize text in LaTeX. Get rid of them
% to turn italics back on.
\renewcommand\emph[1]{#1}
\renewcommand\textit[1]{\underline{\smash{#1}}}

% This is a helpful package that puts math inside length specifications
\usepackage{calc}

% This package helps LaTeX auto-hyphenate hyphenated words if you use
% special hyphens. For example, bio\-/mimicry will properly hyphenate
% ``mimicry'' if necessary.
\usepackage[shortcuts]{extdash}

% Layout: Puts the section titles on left side of page
\reversemarginpar

%
%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

%
% Place at top of document. It should be the first thing.
% If ``right_object'' is provided in the square-braced optional
% argument, it will be right justified on the same line as ``name'' at
% the top of the CV. For example:
%
%       \makeheading[\emph{Curriculum vitae}]{Your Name}
%
% will put an emphasized ``Curriculum vitae'' at the top of the document
% as a title. Likewise, a picture could be included:
%
%   \makeheading[{\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{my_picture}}]{Your Name}
%
% the picture will be flush right across from the name. For this example
% to work, make sure the extra set of curly braces is included. Also

% 4. open source code
            \item \textbf{Created \href{https://github.com/codedsk/hubcheck}{HUBcheck},
                an open source Python library} used to build automation scripts
                and user level tests for HUBzero based websites and simulation tool
                environments.  Built on top of
                \href{http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver}{Selenium WebDriver}
                and \href{https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new}{Firefox}
                to provide web browser automation,
                \href{http://www.paramiko.org}{Paramiko} to provide SSH automation,
                \href{https://bmp.lightbody.net}{BrowserMob Proxy},
                \href{https://www.ffmpeg.org}{FFmpeg},
                \href{http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/}{VNC},
                and X server utilities. With HUBcheck, developers can
                simulate a user's website experience through abstractions of HUB
                web pages and interact with the HUB's virtualized, Debian GNU/Linux
                based simulation tool environment, all from a single script.\\
